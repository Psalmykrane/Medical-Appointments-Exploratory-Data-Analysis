# Medical Appointments Exploratory Data Analysis ⚕️

This project is aimed to understand why people who receive treatment instructions do not show up at the next appointment time. In other words, what are the contributing factors for missing appointments?


## 📝 Project Objectives

- What is the ratio of people who miss appointments to those who don’t?

- Who don’t show up more often — men or women?
- What is the most popular month/day/hour for not showing up?
- What is the age distribution of patients?

This list is not complete — you can extend it with additional questions that come to your mind during the analysis
